# Quick Start

**Worldview** is a react library for rendering 2D and 3D scenes using [regl](https://github.com/regl-project/regl).

Add regl-worldview to your React project:

```bash
npm install --save regl-worldview
```

If you're not using a module bundler or package manager we also have a global ("UMD") build hosted on the unpkg CDN. Simply add the following script tag to the bottom of your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/regl-worldview/dist/index.umd.js" />
```

Then try rendering the [basic example](#/docs/examples/basic-example). [Open in CodePen](https://codepen.io/vidaaudrey/pen/WPwmqg)
