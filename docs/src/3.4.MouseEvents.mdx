# MouseEvents

Currently Worldview supports the following mouse event handlers: `onDoubleClick`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onMouseMove`, and `onClick`. When a supported DOM event is fired, the event handler will be triggered with the original event object and additional event information which can help build interactive views.

| Name                   | type                   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `onDoubleClick`        | `MouseHandler`         |         |                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `getChildrenForHitmap` | `GetChildrenForHitmap` |         | Maps the `children` to props to be drawn on the hitmap. Optional, but required for any mouse interactions. Provided by default by all included Commands. See more below. |

## Event Handler

There are two kinds of event handlers:

**Worldview Level Handlers**

- `ray`: the raw raycasting information including `dir` (direction), `origin`, and `point` (all in `Vec3` format).
- `objects`: an array of objects (`{ object, instanceIndex }`) that you interacted with. The value is `[]` if no object is found. The `enableStackedObjectEvents` option must be set to `true` on `<Worldview>` for this handler to return more than one object.

**Command Component Level Handlers**

- `ray`: the raw raycasting information including `dir` (direction), `origin`, and `point` (all in `Vec3` format).
- `objects`: an array of objects (`{ object, instanceIndex }`) from this command that you interacted with. There will always be at least one object. The `enableStackedObjectEvents` option must be set to `true` on `<Worldview>` for this handler to return more than one object.

```js
<Worldview onClick={(evt, { objects }) => console.log("You clicked on", objects.length && objects[0].object.id)}>
  <Cubes onClick={(evt, { objects }) => console.log("You clicked on", objects[0].object.id)}>{cubes}</Cubes>
  {/* Other command children */}
</Worldview>
```

### Mouse events for instanced objects

Usually using instanced objects can help improve rendering performance, e.g. an instanced sphere can contain thousands of spheres. When the user clicks a single sphere, the object and instance index which was generated will be returned from the event.

_Commands that currently support instanced rendering: Cubes, Points, Spheres, Triangles, Cones, Cylinders. More to be added later._

Example:

```js
<Worldview>
  <Cubes
    onClick={(evt, { objects }) =>
      console.log(`You clicked on ${objects[0].object.id} at index ${objects[0].instanceIndex}`)
    }>
    {cubes}
  </Cubes>
</Worldview>
```

### getChildrenForHitmap and mapping for interactive objects

How do we detect which object was interacted with? We use a process called picking, in which we generate an off-screen canvas, or "hitmap", to paint our objects into, assign each object a unique color, and then paint each object into this hitmap. We then detect which object was clicked on by testing which color was underneath the cursor.

The Worldview library allows a lot of control over this interaction, but most Commands can use one of three default `getChildrenForHitmap` functions.

| Name                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Usage                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nonInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap`       | A default `getChildrenForHitmap` function for non-instanced commands.                                                                                                                                                                            | `<Command getChildrenForHitmap={nonInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap} ... />`       |
| `getChildrenForHitmapWithOriginalMarker` | Almost identical to nonInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap, but instead the object passed to event callbacks is the object at `prop.originalMarker`, not just `prop`. This is useful for composing commands: see the code for `Arrows` for an example. | `<Command getChildrenForHitmap={getChildrenForHitmapWithOriginalMarker} ... />` |
| `createInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap`    | A factory function for instanced commands. It takes the number of points per instance: for example, a triangle has 3 points, whereas a sphere has 1 point (just the center).                                                                     | `<Command getChildrenForHitmap={createInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap(1)} ... />` |

##### Turning off interactivity for a layer

All built in commands allow overriding the `getChildrenForHitmap` function, and we recommend that you also allow users to override it. If a user passes in `null` or `undefined` for `getChildrenForHitmap` in a command, any objects drawn by that command instance will not be visible for interaction purposes. Disabling interaction in this way may help improve performance.

##### event.stopPropagation()

`event.stopPropagation()` on Command Component Level Handlers will prevent other handlers from firing.

```js
/*
  Command Component handler stopping the Worldview level one 
*/
<Worldview onClick={(evt, { objects }) => console.log("This wont fire")}>
  <Cubes
    onClick={(evt, { objects }) => {
      evt.stopPropagation();
      console.log("This will fire");
    }}>
    {cubes}
  </Cubes>
</Worldview>
```

```js
/*
  Command Component handler stopping another one (only happens when enableStackedObjectEvents={true})
*/
<Worldview enableStackedObjectEvents>
  <Cubes
    onClick={(evt, { objects }) => {
      evt.stopPropagation();
      console.log("This will fire");
    }}>
    {cubesInFront}
  </Cubes>
  <Cubes onClick={(evt, { objects }) => console.log("This wont fire")}>{cubesBehind}</Cubes>
</Worldview>
```

##### Customizing the getChildrenForHitmap function

Each Command is passed the `reglCommand` function and `children`. Worldview compiles the `reglCommand` once by calling it with the `regl` object as an argument, and calls the resulting command each frame with `children`. `getChildrenForHitmap` takes in those `children` and returns new version of them that will be rendered into the hitmap.

Some important things to remember:

- The first argument of `getChildrenForHitmap` is the `children`.
- The second argument is a function that helps us assign colors to each object. Each object or instance that you want to differentiate should receive a unique color, since these colors function as unique IDs.

```js
/*
 * object: the object to pass to event callbacks when this object is interacted with.
 * count: How many colors to map to the callback object. If this is greater than 1, this assigns instance indices for the object.
 * return type: an array of the colors assigned.
 */
type AssignNextColorsFn = (object: Object, count: number) => Vec4[];
```

- - Each object that you want to support mouse events on requires a unique color. This color serves as the unique object ID. If your command actually renders multiple items per input object (such as when using [instanced drawing](https://github.com/regl-project/regl/blob/gh-pages/example/instance-triangle.js)), you may want a separate color for each item â€” in this case, call `assignNextColors` with a count greater than 1.
- Once you have this color, make sure to use it as the color of your object. Don't apply any transparency or shading to your object or this will mess up the hitmap.

Example using composition of the default `getChildrenForHitmap` functions:

```js
<Worldview>
  <Points
    onClick={(evt, { objects }) => console.log(`You clicked on ${objects[0].object.id}`)}
    getChildrenForHitmap={(props, assignNextColors, excludedObjects) => {
      const hitmapProps = nonInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap(props, assignNextColors, excludedObjects);
      // Points are hard to click, so expand their hitmap so that clicking slightly outside of a point still selects it.
      for (hitmapProp of hitmapProps) {
        hitmapProp.scale = { x: hitmapProps.scale.x * 1.1, y: hitmapProps.scale.y * 1.1, z: hitmapProps.scale.z * 1.1 };
      }
      return hitmapProps;
    }}>
    {points}
  </Points>
</Worldview>
```

Example using a custom `getChildrenForHitmap` function:

```js
<Worldview>
  <Points
    onClick={(evt, { objects }) => console.log(`You clicked on ${objects[0].object.id}`)}
    getChildrenForHitmap={(props, assignNextColors, excludedObjects) => {
      // This is a simplified version of nonInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap, for explanation purposes.
      return propsArray.map((prop) => {
        // Don't render objects that have been excluded.
        // Objects are excluded when we enable stacked object events. If this object has already been evented on, we
        // want to event on the objects underneath it, so don't allow drawing it.
        if (excludedObjects.find({ object }) => object === prop)) {
          return null;
        }
        // We copy each point array.
        const hitmapProp = { ...prop };
        // We get 1 new color, and pass in the original prop so it will be the object passed to any event handlers.
        const [hitmapColor] = assignNextColors(object, 1);
        hitmapProp.color = hitmapColor;
        if (hitmapProp.points) {
          hitmapProp.colors = new Array(hitmapProp.points.length).fill(hitmapColor);
        }
        return hitmapProp;
      }).filter(Boolean); // filter out any excluded objects here
    }}
  >
    {points}
  </Points>
</Worldview>
```

### Instanced/regular rendering example

## Full Example

## Other

`onClick` events don't fire if the user moves the cursor for more than 3 screen pixels between mouse down and mouse up. This ensures that dragging the mouse to pan the Worldview camera doesn't also trigger an `onClick` event.
