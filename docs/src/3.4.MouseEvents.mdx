# MouseEvents

Currently Worldview supports the following mouse event handlers: `onDoubleClick`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onMouseMove`, and `onClick`. When a supported DOM event is fired, the event handler will be triggered with the original event object and additional event information which can help build interactive views.

| Name            | type           | Default | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onDoubleClick` | `MouseHandler` |         |                                                                                              |
| `onMouseDown`   | `MouseHandler` |         |                                                                                              |
| `onMouseUp`     | `MouseHandler` |         |                                                                                              |
| `onMouseMove`   | `MouseHandler` |         | only available if the `hitmapOnMouseMove` prop is set to `true` on the `Worldview` component |
| `onClick`       | `MouseHandler` |         |                                                                                              |

## Event Handler

There are two kinds of event handlers:

**Worldview Level Handlers**

- `ray`: the raw raycasting information including `dir` (direction), `origin`, and `point` (all in `Vec3` format).
- `objectId`: the id of the object that you interacted with. The value is `undefined` if no object is found.

**Command Component Level Handlers**

- `ray`: the raw raycasting information including `dir` (direction), `origin`, and `point` (all in `Vec3` format).
- `object`: the object that you interacted with. The value is `undefined` if no object is found.
- `objectId`: the id of the object that you interacted with. The value is `undefined` if no object is found.

```js
<Worldview onClick={(evt, { objectId }) => console.log("You clicked on", objectId)}>
  <Cubes onClick={(evt, { object, objectId }) => console.log("You clicked on", objectId)}>{cubes}</Cubes>
  {/* Other command children */}
</Worldview>
```

## Hitmap Id Mapping

The `objectId`, also refered as `hitmapId`, is how we identify the objects that you interacted with.

There are two ways to manage hitmap ids:

**Automatic**

For some commonly supported command components such as Cubes, Spheres and Cones, when a supported mouse handler exists in props, and the marker has an `id` field, we'll automatically manage the hitmap id mapping. The returned object will contain the original marker fields and an additional (or replaced) `color` field that was generated for the hitmap id mapping. _Note the `id` should be positive integer._

```js
<Cubes onClick={(ev, {object}) => {console.log("Cube marker with hitmap color field", object)}}>
  [{
    id: 212,
    ...restOfCubeMarker
  }]
</Cubes>
```

**Custom**

You can also customize hitmap id mapping through `getHitmapProps` and `getObjectFromHitmapId` props. Both of the two props must be present because providing only one may cause incorrect mapping.

- `getHitmapProps`: the function takes the original marker children as input, and map the children to `hitmapProps` which contains `color` or `colors` (for instanced rendering) field.
- `getObjectFromHitmapId`: the function takes the `objectId`/`hitmapId` and `hitmapProps`. When a mouse event is fired, we read the color from the interaction point and map it back to an `objectId`. We'll try to find the exact `hitmapProp` / object that matches the `objectId` by iterating through the `hitmapProps`. If no `hitmapProp` is found, the event callback won't be triggered.

_It's important to keep the object `id` unique if you want to keep track of the objects._

### Hitmap for Instanced Objects

Usually using instanced objects can help improve rendering performance, e.g. an instanced sphere can contain thousands of spheres. When the user clicks a single sphere, the mapped instanceId (returned as `objectId`) which was generated through `getHitmapProps` function will be returned from the event.

_Commands that currently support instanced rendering: Cubes, Points, Spheres, Triangles, Cones, Cylinders. More to be added later._

Check out below example for automatic/custom hitmap mapping, and regular/instanced rendering:

## Full Example

<MouseEvents />

## Other

`onClick` events don't fire if the user moved the cursor for more than 3 screen pixels between mouse down and mouse up. This helps implement certain behaviors such as panning around worldview without firing `onClick` event.
