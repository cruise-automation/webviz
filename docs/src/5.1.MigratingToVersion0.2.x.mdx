# Migrating from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

The 0.2.1 Worldview release brought a new API for managing interactions and a variety of changes to how interactions are done. This is a breaking change - code that worked under 0.1.x may silently fail under 0.2.x. Below is a summary of what changed and how to update your own code.

## Mouse event changes

Previously, the Worldview-level event handler only passed an `objectId`, not the full object being clicked. Now both the Worldview-level event handlers and Command-level event handlers pass the same information about the click: the ray, and an array of objects that contain the object being clicked and the `instanceIndex`, if the clicked object is part of an instanced command.

We now pass an array of objects because stacked object events can now optionally be enabled: passing `enableStackedObjectEvents={true}` to the `Worldview` component allows seeing all objects at the point the user clicked on, instead of just the top-level object.
```js
// New type
type ClickedObject = {
  object: Object,
  instanceIndex?: ?number,
};

export type ReglClickInfo = {
  ray: Ray,
  objects: Array<ClickedObject>,
};

export type MouseHandler = (MouseEvent, ReglClickInfo) => void;
```

Usage:

```js
// Old
<Worldview
  onClick={(event, { ray, objectId }) => {
    setSelectedObjectId(objectId);
  }}>
  ...
</Worldview>
// New
<Worldview
  onClick={(event, { ray, objects }) => {
    setSelectedObjects(objects.map(({ object, instanceIndex }) => object));
  }}
  enableStackedObjectEvents>
  ...
</Worldview>
```

## Hitmap changes

How do we detect which object was interacted with? We use a process called picking, in which we generate an off-screen canvas, or "hitmap", to paint our objects into, assign each object a unique color, and then paint each object into this hitmap. We then detect which object was clicked on by testing which color was underneath the cursor.

For stacked objects, we run this hitmap rendering multiple times. We note which object was picked, then exclude it from the next rendering cycle, until we stop hitting objects.

Previously, the assignment of these colors (also referred to as `hitmapIds`) was passed into each Command. Now there is an API for drawing these colors in a more scalable way.

This means that we no longer support passing the `getObjectFromHitmapId`, `getHitmapId`, `getHitmapProps`, or `hitmapProps` props into a Command instance.

Instead we have a single function, `getChildrenForHitmap`. This function takes as arguments the children passed into the Command, another function that helps assign colors for the hitmap, and a list of objects that we want to exclude from rendering (used for stacked object hitmaps). It returns new children that we use for rendering to the hitmap.

Similarly to the previous API, there are a few default `getChildrenForHitmap` functions available to you to use.

```js
// Old
<Cubes getHitmapId={getHitmapId} getObjectFromHitmapId={getObjectFromHitmapId}>{cubes}</Cubes>

// New
<Cubes getChildrenForHitmap={createInstancedGetChildrenForHitmap(1)}>{cubes}</Cubes>
```

See [MouseEvents](#/docs/api/mouse-events) for further info on the new hitmapId API.

## Command syntax changes

Because the Command has been simplified, there wasn't any need for a `makeCommand` wrapper any longer. The `makeCommand` function has been removed. Simply wrap the `Command` in another React component that passes it's props through, while specifying the `getChildrenForHitmap` function and the `reglCommand`. It's recommended that the `getChildrenForHitmap` function be overrideable and the `reglCommand` not be overrideable through props - see [MouseEvents](#/docs/api/mouse-events) for more on this.

To help with flow typing props that all Commands can have such as `layerIndex` or mouse event handlers, we provide the `CommonCommandProps` export.

One minor change: Commands no longer takes a `drawProps` prop. Pass the objects that you want to render as `children`.

```js
// Old
const Cubes = makeCommand("Cubes", rawReglCommand, {
  getHitmapProps: () => {...},
  getObjectFromHitmapId:  () => {...},
});

// New
export default function Cubes(props: { ...CommonCommandProps, children: Cube[] }) {
  // Commands no longer takes a `drawProps` prop. Pass the objects that you want to render as `children`.
  // reglCommand is not overrideable, but getChildrenForHitmap is.
  return <Command getChildrenForHitmap={...} {...props} reglCommand={cubes} />;
}
```
