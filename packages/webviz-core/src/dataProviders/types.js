// `DataProvider` describes a more specific kind of data ingesting than `Player`, namely ingesting
// data that we have random access to. From Wikipedia:
//
//   "Random access is the ability to access an arbitrary element of a sequence in equal time or any
//    datum from a population of addressable elements roughly as easily and efficiently as any other,
//    no matter how many elements may be in the set."
//
// The data is stored somewhere (e.g. in a local file, or on some server), in some sort of
// representation (e.g. a ROS bag, or a JSON file, or something else). Conceptually, we treat the
// data as static and immutable, which means that when you fetch the same time range twice, you
// should get the exact same messages, and when you fetch one time range, you should get the exact
// same messages as when splitting it into two fetch calls with shorter time ranges.
//
// A DataProvider initially returns basic information, such as the time range for which we have data,
// and the topics and data types. It then allows for requesting messages for arbitrary time ranges
// within, though it is the caller's responsibility to request small enough time ranges, since in
// general DataProviders give no guarantees of how fast they return the data.
//
// The properties of immutability and idempotence make it very easy to compose different
// DataProviders. For example, you can have a BagDataProvider which reads from a ROS bag, but which
// takes a bit of time to decompress the ROS bag. So you might wrap it in a WorkerDataProvider,
// which puts its children in a Web Worker, therefore allowing the decompression to happen in
// parallel to the main thread. And you might wrap that in turn in a MemoryCacheDataProvider, which
// does some in-memory read-ahead caching based on the most recent time range that was requested.
// These trees of DataProviders are described by `DataProviderDescriptor`.
//
// DataProviders have a strict API which is enforced automatically in ApiCheckerDataProvider. It's
// also easy to measure the performance of each DataProvider in a tree by putting using the
// `_measureDataProviders` URL param, which causes every DataProvider to be wrapped in a
// MeasureDataProvider.

// We disable no-use-before-define so we can have the most important types at the top.
