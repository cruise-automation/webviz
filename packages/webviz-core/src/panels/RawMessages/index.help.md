# Raw Messages

Displays the data from a specific topic in an easier to read format. As new messages are received the structure shows the latest data, but doesn't reset the view (e.g if you unfold a specific key - it'll stay that way with the values under it updating as messages come in).

You can drill down the message and filter arrays to specific messages using the [message path syntax](/help/message-path-syntax).

If you need to understand the data structure of the messages, a link is provided at the top.
