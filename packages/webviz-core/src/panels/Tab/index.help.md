# Tab

Allows users to group multiple Webviz panels in a mini layout, each nested under a tab.

## Selecting Panels to Group

Select the first panel with a click, and select subsequent panels via `Cmd` + click. To deselect a panel, use `Cmd` + click.

To quickly select all panels in a layout, use `Cmd` + `a`, or click on the "Select all panels" option in the app's "Config" menu in the top-right.

Users can group the selected panels in one of 2 ways:

- Combine selected panels under a single tab in a new Tab panel
- Create a separate tab for each selected panel in a new Tab panel

Hovering over any selected panel will allow you to make your choice.
