# Table

Displays data similar to `RawMessages` but in a tabular format. You can use the typical message-path syntax to do things like drilling down to a particular value, or filtering.

To sort rows in the table, click in the headers. To multi-sort once you've already sorted on a particular value, hold `shift` and click a header.
