# Table

Displays data similar to `RawMessages` but in a tabular format. You can use the typical message-path syntax to do things like drilling down to a particular value, or filtering.

To sort rows in the table, click in the headers. To multi-sort once you've already sorted on a particular value, hold `shift` and click a header.

## Conditional Formatting

You can add custom coloring to columns based on a rule, such as `val > 1`. To accomplish this, open the table settings dropdown in the top left corner of the panel and add a rule. From there, use your column name, add a comparator and a primitive value. You can edit the color widget to see your formatting update in real time.
