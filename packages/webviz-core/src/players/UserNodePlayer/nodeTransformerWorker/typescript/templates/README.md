# Node Playground Templates

## Contributing

Please feel free to add any template you like in this directory with a `*.ts` extension. Then reference that template in the `templates/index.js` file as is done with the other templates.

Then open up a PR in the webviz repo and post in the webviz channel. We'll make sure a team member looks at it in a timely manner! :)
