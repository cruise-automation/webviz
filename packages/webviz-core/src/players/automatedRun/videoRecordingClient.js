// This is the interface between the video recording server (recordVideo.js) and
// the client (whomever uses `videoRecordingClient`). The idea is that the server opens a webpage
// that runs a client, and from that point on, the client is in control. Essentially, the client
// makes remote procedure calls to the server, which the server executes and then acknowledges.
// Right now there are only three calls to the server:
// - "error" (which throws an error and aborts);
// - "finish" (to close the browser and generate the actual video);
// - "screenshot" (take a screenshot and acknowledge when done, so we can continue).
