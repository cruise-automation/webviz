MetaDatabase

This IndexedDB instance is a hardcoded reference to the dynamically named
databases from different players, such that we can figure out whether we
need to create a new instance or not. In terms of data integrity, things only
get evicted if a global limit, which is correlated with origin of the saved
resource. Attempting to exceed global limit (which is based on available disk
space) does trigger eviction, but does so based on origin, so they won't try to
delete just parts of your data. The other type of limit we could potentially
violate is group limit, but it's just a hard limit based on origin and does not
trigger any eviction.
